# Vertical Slice Architecture: The Best Ways to Structure Your Project

## Overview

Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) is a design approach that organizes an application by features rather than traditional technical layers. Each slice encapsulates all aspects of a specific feature, including the UI, business logic, and data access. This contrasts with conventional architectures that typically segregate an application into horizontal layers.

## Comparison with Other Architectures

### N-Tier Architecture

N-Tier Architecture organizes the application into distinct layers, typically including:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles the UI and user interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Contains the core functionality and business rules.
- **Data Access Layer:** Manages data retrieval and storage.

#### Differences between N-Tier and Vertical Slice Architecture:

- **Organization:** VSA organizes by feature (vertical), while N-Tier organizes by function (horizontal).
- **Coupling:** N-Tier can lead to tight coupling between layers, whereas VSA promotes loose coupling between features.
- **Modification Impact:** Modifying a feature in N-Tier might involve changes across multiple layers, whereas in VSA, changes are contained within the feature slice.

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture aims to separate the concerns of the application into distinct layers, promoting high cohesion and low coupling. It consists of the following layers:

- **Domain:** Contains core business objects such as entities.
- **Application Layer:** Implementation of application use cases.
- **Infrastructure:** Implementation of external dependencies like databases, caches, message queues, authentication providers, etc.
- **Presentation:** Implementation of an interface with the outside world like Web API, gRPC, GraphQL, MVC, etc.

#### Differences between Clean Architecture and Vertical Slice Architecture:

- **Focus:** Both emphasize separation of concerns, but VSA focuses on feature-specific separation while Clean Architecture separates by role and responsibility.
- **Testability:** Clean Architecture is designed for testability by isolating business logic. VSA can achieve similar testability by containing all logic within feature slices.
- **Change Flexibility:** VSA allows for more flexible and feature-specific changes, whereas Clean Architecture promotes reusability and clarity across the application.

## Advantages of Vertical Slice Architecture

Vertical Slice Architecture is becoming increasingly popular for structuring projects due to its many advantages:

- **Feature Focused:** Changes are isolated to specific features, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
- **Scalability:** Easier to scale development by allowing developers and teams to work on different features independently.
- **Flexibility:** Allows using different technologies or approaches within each slice as needed.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to navigate the solution, understand, and maintain since all aspects of a feature are contained within a single slice.
- **Reduced Coupling:** Minimizes dependencies between different slices.

## Disadvantages of Vertical Slice Architecture

Every architectural style has trade-offs, and Vertical Slice Architecture is no exception. Here are some potential disadvantages:

- **Duplication:** Potential for code duplication across slices.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring consistency across slices and managing cross-cutting concerns (e.g., error handling, logging, validation) requires careful planning.
- **Large Number of Classes and Files:** A large application can have many vertical slices, each containing multiple small classes.

To address the first two disadvantages, consider carefully designing your architecture. For example, you can extract common functionality into its own classes and use MediatR pipelines to manage cross-cutting concerns such as error handling, logging, and validation.

The third disadvantage can be managed with a good folder structure, which will be discussed in a future blog post.

## Conclusion

Vertical Slice Architecture provides a compelling alternative to traditional architectural patterns, focusing on feature encapsulation, loose coupling, and maintainability. Understanding the trade-offs can help teams make informed decisions about structuring their applications.
